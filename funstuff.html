            I love editing videos! I have been doing it since high school and have so much fun doing it!
            I currently use Filmora9 and FilmoraPro!
            I used to use PremierePro, but that was when I got it through school and now it's too expensive!
            It's $30/month! As a college student who servers tables to make her money, this was not in my budget!
            Here is a example of some of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shotersinn" target="_blank">my work!</a>

            <br>
            I also enjoy sewing and costume making!
            I usually make my own halloween costumes!
            Recently, I have started using foam to make costumes!
            Last Halloween, I was wonderwoman and made the whole thing out of foam!

            I love playing video games!
            I mainly play Fortnite and Overwatch, but recently have been getting into Among Us!
            If you haven't heard of Among Us, it's like Mafia where you try and figure out who the killer or (in this case) imposter is!
            It's a great game for groups of people but can also be fun alone!
