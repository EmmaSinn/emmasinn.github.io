            Last semester, I took the senior capstone where we made a product that acted as a virtural waiter.
            I worked on the database team and together with out other teams, we created, AutoGarcon.
            AutoGarcon featured an app where the customers could order from while they sat at a table in a sit-down restruant.
            They also could order off an Amazon Alexa that would be placed at a table for the customer's convenience.
            The website was for the restruant staff. It allowed the cooks to access the orders so the food could be prepared
            and for the management to be able to make changes to a bill and to the items available to a restruant.
            With my team, we were in charge of setting up and modifying the database. We were in charge of all the data our product needed to store.
            We also set up the interface between the database and the other three teams so the website, the app, and Alexa's could access the
            necessary information.

            In an Artificial Intelligence and Robotics class, I got the chance to learn about AIs and how to create one.
            The AIs we created were fairly simple compared to modern day AIs but it was a good start to be introduced to how the world of Articial Intelligence works.
            We used choco-solver to implement our AIs to run games. The game we design was a form of Wumpus World except we called it Student World.
            Esentially, however, the game is the same. For more information on the game, you can look
